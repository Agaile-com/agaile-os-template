# HIL (Human-in-the-Loop) Development Methodology v3.0

> **AgAIle: Where Agile Meets AI - Reimagining Software Development**  
> A complete sprint-based development lifecycle with AI automation and strategic human oversight

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

HIL methodology implements **AgAIle** - our evolution of Agile/Scrum practices enhanced by AI automation, with humans maintaining control at **critical decision points**. It's not sequential waterfall - it's continuous sprints with parallel activities.

### The HIL Principle
```
AI Executes → Humans Decide → AI Implements → Humans Validate
```

## 🔄 The 8-Phase AgAIle Sprint Model

### 🌊 Continuous Practices (Throughout All Phases)
These happen continuously, not sequentially:

```yaml
Throughout Every Sprint:
  Version Control:     /g --commit, /g --pr          [Human: Review PRs]
  Documentation:       /documenter --auto-update     [Human: Verify accuracy]
  Security Scanning:   /quality --security           [Human: Approve fixes]
  Team Collaboration:  /patterns --share             [Human: Approve patterns]
```

## Phase 1: Discovery & Design 🎯
**Duration**: 1-2 days per feature  
**Purpose**: Transform business needs into technical specifications

### Commands & Automation
```bash
/plan-product "SaaS platform requirement"     # AI: Generates architecture
/create-feature "User authentication system"  # AI: Creates comprehensive specs
/analyze-product                             # AI: Analyzes existing patterns
```

### 👤 **Human-in-the-Loop Points**
