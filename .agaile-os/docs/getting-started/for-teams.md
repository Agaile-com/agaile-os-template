## üöÄ Phased Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot Team (Week 1-2)
```bash
# Select 3-5 developers for initial adoption
# Focus: Development environment only

/setup-team --pilot --members 5
/configure --environment development
/set-confidence --threshold 60 --require-approval
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to implement standard features
- Code quality metrics
- Developer satisfaction scores

### Phase 2: Expand to Squad (Week 3-4)
```bash
# Add remaining squad members
# Include: Staging deployments

/setup-team --expand --include-qa
/configure --environment staging
/enable-patterns --share-team
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Bug reduction rate
- Deployment frequency
- Code review time reduction

### Phase 3: Cross-Team Adoption (Week 5-8)
```bash
# Roll out to multiple teams
# Include: Shared pattern library

/setup-organization --teams all
/pattern-library --mode centralized
/governance --enable-policies
```

**Success Metrics:**
- Cross-team velocity improvement
- Pattern reuse rate
- Standardization compliance

### Phase 4: Production Enablement (Week 9-12)
```bash
# Enable production deployments
# Full governance and compliance

/configure --environment production
