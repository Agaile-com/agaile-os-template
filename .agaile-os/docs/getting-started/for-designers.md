# Getting Started for Designers & No-Coders

Welcome! This guide will help you build professional applications without writing a single line of code.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Achieve

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Built a complete landing page
- Added user authentication
- Deployed to the web
- All without coding!

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

### Required (10 minutes to set up)
1. **Cursor IDE** - [Download Free](https://cursor.sh)
2. **Claude API Key** - [Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Add $5 credit to start
   - This will last for several projects

### Optional but Helpful
- A Vercel account for deployment (free)
- Basic familiarity with folders and files

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Cursor
1. Download Cursor from [cursor.sh](https://cursor.sh)
2. Open Cursor
3. It looks like a code editor, but you won't be coding!

### Step 2: Set Up Your Project
1. Create a new folder for your project
2. Open that folder in Cursor
3. Copy the AgAIle-OS files into your project:
   ```
   Download from: github.com/Agaile-com/agaile-os-template
   Extract into your project folder
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Claude
1. In Cursor, press `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (PC)
2. Search for "Claude"
3. Add your API key
4. Select "Claude Opus" as your model

### Step 4: Your First Magic Moment

Type this in Cursor's AI chat (Cmd+K):

```
/create-feature "Build me a modern landing page with:
  - A hero section with my company name 'MyAwesomeApp'
  - Three feature cards explaining benefits
  - A pricing section with Basic ($9) and Pro ($29) plans
  - An email signup form
  - Modern, professional design with animations"
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Common Design Tasks

### Creating a Navigation Menu
```
/create-feature "Add a sticky navigation bar with:
  - Logo on the left
  - Menu items: Features, Pricing, About, Contact
  - Sign Up button on the right
  - Mobile hamburger menu"
```

### Adding a Contact Form
```
/create-feature "Create a contact form with:
  - Name, email, and message fields
  - Send emails to my@email.com
  - Success message after sending
  - Modern styling with validation"
```

### Making It Mobile-Friendly
```
/execute-tasks "Make the entire site responsive:
  - Mobile-first design
  - Tablet breakpoints
  - Touch-friendly buttons
  - Optimized images"
```

## ðŸŽ­ Design Customization

### Changing Colors and Styles
```
/execute-tasks "Update the design:
  - Primary color: #6B46C1 (purple)
  - Font: Inter for headings, system fonts for body
  - Rounded corners on all cards
  - Subtle shadows for depth"
```

### Adding Animations
```
/create-feature "Add smooth animations:
  - Fade in on scroll
  - Hover effects on buttons
  - Smooth transitions between sections
  - Loading animations"
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment (Making It Live)

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)
```
/ci-cd "Deploy to Vercel:
  - Connect to my Vercel account
  - Set up automatic deployments
  - Configure custom domain (if I have one)"
```

The AI will guide you through:
1. Creating a Vercel account (if needed)
2. Connecting your project
3. Getting a live URL

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Non-Coders

### 1. Be Specific
Instead of: "Make a nice header"
Try: "Create a header with a gradient background from purple to blue, with white text and a call-to-action button"

### 2. Reference Existing Sites
"Make it look like Stripe's pricing page but with my colors"

### 3. Use Visual Descriptions
"Add a card that looks like it's floating with a shadow underneath"

### 4. Iterate Gradually
Start simple, then add features:
1. First: "Create a basic landing page"
2. Then: "Add animations to the buttons"
3. Finally: "Add a dark mode toggle"

## ðŸŽ¯ Complete Project Example

Here's a full project you can build in 30 minutes:

```
Step 1: /plan-product "Personal portfolio website for a designer"

Step 2: /create-feature "Homepage with:
  - Hero section with my name and title
  - Portfolio grid showing 6 projects
  - About me section
  - Contact form"

Step 3: /create-feature "Portfolio case studies:
  - Individual page for each project
  - Image galleries
  - Project descriptions"

Step 4: /execute-tasks "Add professional touches:
