# Project Master Tracking Document

**Last Updated**: [Update Date]  
**Framework Version**: 1.0  
**Current Release**: [Release Version] ([Completion %] complete)

## Overview

This master tracking document provides centralized oversight of your project's development initiatives, linking strategic roadmap phases to customer problems (PRDs), strategic initiatives (Epics), and technical execution (Features).

## Framework Structure

```
Customer Voice â†’ PRD (Problem) â†’ Epic (Strategy) â†’ Feature (Solution) â†’ Task (Implementation)
```

### Strategic Roadmap Alignment

This document operates in full alignment with the [Strategic Roadmap](product/roadmap.md), providing tactical execution tracking for strategic phases:

| Current Phase | Roadmap Reference | Active Epics | Target Outcome |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Phase 1: [Foundation Phase]** | [Reference] | [Epic 1]<br/>[Epic 2] | [Key Outcome] |
| **Planned: Phase 2** | [Next Phase] | [Future Epic 1]<br/>[Future Epic 2] | [Next Outcome] |

**Key Integration Points**:
- Roadmap defines **strategic phases** and market timing
- Master Tracking manages **tactical Epic delivery** and feature progress  
- Both reference the same **semantic features** (e.g., `user-authentication`)
- Epic success metrics align with **roadmap phase objectives**

### Hierarchical Organization

- **PRDs**: Customer problem consolidation and business requirements
- **Epics**: Strategic coordination of related PRDs and features
- **Features**: Technical solutions delivering customer value
- **Tasks**: Granular implementation work (tracked in HIL workflow)
